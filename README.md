# Welcome to our group project - SPACE EXPLORER!

## This project is created by utilizing HTML, CSS, Bulma and JavaScript with the addition of the Space Devs API and NASA's Astronomy Image of the Day API!

## CALLING ALL SPACE LOVERS!

> ### AS A person who loves space,
>
> ### I WANT to learn more about historical launches, my favorite astronaut, and view NASAâ€™s astronomy image of the day,
>
> ### SO THAT I have a greater appreciation for what NASA has accomplished and what it is still working so hard to provide.

## Once the Space Explorer opens, you will be greeted with two images. One image is a space shuttle launch and the other image is an astronmy image.
